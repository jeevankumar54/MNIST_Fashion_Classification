# MNIST_Fashion_Classification

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to design, implement, and evaluate Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for the accurate classification of fashion images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. This project aims to strike a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency by leveraging both traditional ANN architectures and more advanced CNN models tailored for image data.


## About the Dataset

The Fashion MNIST dataset is a benchmark dataset widely used for image classification tasks. It contains 70,000 grayscale images of size 28x28 pixels, divided into 60,000 training samples and 10,000 testing samples. Each image represents one of 10 distinct categories of fashion items, such as T-shirts, trousers, dresses, and sneakers.


## Project Goals

### 1.Develop an Artificial Neural Network (ANN):  
   * Design a fully connected ANN architecture as a baseline for classification.  
   * Focus on achieving reasonable accuracy while maintaining simplicity in implementation.  
### 2.Develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):  
   * Build a CNN architecture optimized for image data.  
   * Incorporate convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dropout to enhance accuracy and reduce overfitting.
### 3.Comparison and Evaluation:  
   * Compare the performance of the ANN and CNN models in terms of accuracy, training time, and computational efficiency.  
   * Fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize the performance of both models.  
### 4.Visualization and Results:
   * Provide clear visualizations, such as loss and accuracy curves, confusion matrices, and sample predictions, to illustrate the performance of the models.
### 5.Documentation and Codebase:
   * Ensure a well-structured and modular codebase for ease of understanding and reproducibility.
   * Document the design choices, challenges, and improvements made during the project.
